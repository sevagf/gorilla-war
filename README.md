# gorilla-war
This C++ application was written in 2002 as part of my high school computer science class final project. It written and designed by a team of four including myself. It's a very simple MS-DOS game where two players use one keyboard to control their Gorillas who throw bananas at each other. Counterintuitively, bananas decrease the Gorilla's health (I'm not sure what the high school version of me was thinking). If you can find an MS-DOS emulator, you can play the game.
